			<Text>With his father and brother dead, Eddard was now the Lord of Winterfell. Eddard called his banners, and marched south to join Robert and Jon, arriving in time to turn the tide at the Battle of the Bells. Afterward, he went to Riverrun to marry Catelyn Tully, who had been betrothed to his brother Brandon before his death. Jon Arryn married Catelyn's sister Lysa in the same ceremony. The double wedding bound House Tully to the rebels' cause. During his marriage to Catelyn, he had five children with her: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon.</Text>
